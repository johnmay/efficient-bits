	 * registered objects when the method {@link #cleanupMarkedObjects(int)}
	 * is called with the same wave. Note: If the last parameter is set to
	 * true and the same rdkitObject was already registered for another wave
	 * (or no wave) it will be removed from the former wave list and will
	 * exist only in the wave specified here. This can be useful for
	 * instance, if an object is first marked as part of a wave and later on
	 * it is determined that it needs to live longer (e.g. without a wave).

	 * id, the second time without wave id (which would internally be wave =
	 * 0).

	 *            An RDKit related object that should free resources when
	 *            not used anymore. Can be null.
